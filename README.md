# InputRecorder
 Python Program that listen/record input and can replay it.
 This is a side project so don't take it that seriously.

### Additional Notes
<!--* Praise the pickle. -->
* TODO: Add requirement.txt for ease 1ยบ usage/"installation"; (for now good luck)
* TODO?: Add compatibility with controllers; (don't count to much on it) 
* At the moment _has_default_press_duration_ and _default_press_duration_in_secs_ have no functionality.
